<!-- Portfolio check-in 1 (Mike Miller) -->
I asked Mike Miller for feedback. Below, you can find his comments.

This is definitely a good start! A couple of notes:
- The home page has two sets of “navigation.” I would narrow that down to one, and maybe just put a short introduction.
- Be careful with the skills you list, as that leaves you open for question. If you list Java and Python, people may ask for sample with in those languages.
- Give some context to your projects. Maybe describe that they are supposed to do, or what the functionality behind them is.



- I had to ask him for some clarification on this point. He said that my home page has the primary navigation in the top right and the big circle buttons and they link to the same pages. 
-- This is not an issue because the home page does not have a navbar on the right. 

- I took out Java and Python from the skills page
- I added a short intro to both my jquery and jsmodal folders.

I asked my father, who knows nothing about coding and web development, for his opinion. I also asked my former classmate, Jeremy Andaya, for his help. 

-My father does not like the initial picture on my intro page. 
-He is not a fan of dandelions and he thinks the color is lackluster. 
-He did say the pink font looks good against the background.

Jeremy
-He doesn't think I should have future in front of full-stack web developer because the course is ending pretty soon. 
	-I have changed this to junior full-stack web developer.

-He said the screenshots on my work page needed to be larger.
	-I have taken care of this.

-He said the image on my work page needs to be adjusted so that the background doesn't look warped.
	-I have not taken care of this problem. I am not sure how.
