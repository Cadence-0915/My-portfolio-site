I asked Mike Miller for feedback. Below, you can find his comments.

This is definitely a good start! A couple of notes:
- The home page has two sets of “navigation.” I would narrow that down to one, and maybe just put a short introduction.
- Be careful with the skills you list, as that leaves you open for question. If you list Java and Python, people may ask for sample with in those languages.
- Give some context to your projects. Maybe describe that they are supposed to do, or what the functionality behind them is.



- I had to ask him for some clarification on this point. He said that my home page has the primary navigation in the top right and the big circle buttons and they link to the same pages. 
-- This is not an issue because the home page does not have a navbar on the right. 

- I took out Java and Python from the skills page
