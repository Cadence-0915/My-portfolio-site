I asked Mike Miller for feedback. Below, you can find his comments.

This is definitely a good start! A couple of notes:
- The home page has two sets of “navigation.” I would narrow that down to one, and maybe just put a short introduction.
- Be careful with the skills you list, as that leaves you open for question. If you list Java and Python, people may ask for sample with in those languages.
- Give some context to your projects. Maybe describe that they are supposed to do, or what the functionality behind them is.
